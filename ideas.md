**Project Ideas**

- Toggleable zen/dark/light color schemes
- Changeable journal book styles (immersion, customization)
- Text looks like handwriting (immersion)
- Expandable + highly customizable analytics
- Voice-to-text journaling
- Gentle reminders to keep daily streak going (how do other 'game-ified' apps encourage users to keep streaks?)
- Weekly highlights?
- Some inclusion of simple, non-intrusive parallax
- Daily impressions for super simple thoughts of events, feelings
- Daily impressions available while writing as reference 
- Include examples of daily impressions and entries to demonstrate their intended simplicity
- Convenient importing/exporting with other text formats (what other formats would ppl want?)

**General Principles**
- Minimal
- User-customizable
- Low friction
- Immersive (feels like using a more convenient version of a real journal)
- What would I want in my own journal?

**TODO**
- Recreate AI-generated logo in my own style
- GET HTML CSS
